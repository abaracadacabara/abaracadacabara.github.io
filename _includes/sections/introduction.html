<h2 id="introduction"> Introduction </h2>

Among the enormous volume of tweets exchanged during the 2016 US presidential election campaign, millions were sent by alleged Russian troll accounts. Those accounts have been accused of manipulating the campaign and its outcome.

Given how dramatic and dangerous the consequences of a country influencing the democratic process of another can be, we want to get a better insight on the methods and the real effects of the trolls.

On one side, we will compare their activities with the evolution of popularity of the candidates along the campaign. We will also take a look at the major events of the election and determine if they were influenced by the trolls and vice-versa.

On the other side, we will study the methods employed by the Russians to disrupt the presidential election. We will examine their vocabulary, the subjects they discuss as well as the media and people they refer to.</br>
</br>

Our analysis will mainly focus on trying to provide an answer to the following questions.</br>
</br>
<ul>
  <li>Is there a relation between the candidates popularities and the activities of the trolls? </li>
  <li>Did the trolls influence the major events of the campaign? Is it the other way around? </li>
  <li>Which subjects are discussed by the trolls?</li>
  <li>Which media do they tend to talk about and link in their posts?</li>
  <li>Do they tend to show direct support or hatred for specific people?</li>
  <li>Did the strategy of the trolls change over time?</li>
</ul>

<h2> Dataset </h2>
The main dataset we are going to use for this project is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GBsVXYvPrGcYI-wR4mWGO39fly1TMqjO/view">the Russian and Iranian Troll</a> dataset from <a href="https://about.twitter.com/en_us/values/elections-integrity.html#data">Twitter</a>. It contains over 10 million tweets of accounts associated with IRA and Iranian trolls. It gives information about the account itself (Twitter handle, number of followers and following, account preferences...), and about the individual tweet (content, date and time of publication, type of post, number of retweets...).
</br>
</br>
Regarding the popularities of the candidates, we have identified an important amount of data source on <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/president/#">realclearpolitics.com</a>.
</br>
</br>
We also took a look at the events after the campaign, with for example the evolution of the approval rate of Donald Trump proposed by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo">FiveFirtyEight</a>.
</br>
</br>
Finally, for the timeline of the campaign and its major events, <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2016_United_States_presidential_election>Wikipedia</a> has a lot of information.

<b> NOTE </b> : <i>Not all the tweets collected are trolls</i>. Actually all the tweets present in our database were sent by identified troll accounts (at least this is the assumption one has to make while working on this dataset) but for most of these latter they seem to have played the game cleverly. In order not to be spotted immediately as fake foreign accounts they did also manage to ressemble as any other american/russian account. Therefore there exist plenty of <i>innocent</i> and <i>unrelated</i> tweets that were also written aside by troll accounts for them to pretend to be just normal.
